    <p>My Love,</p>
    <p>
      Today, your business turns 2 years old, and my heart is full of pride. I have 
      watched you start with just a dream, and Iâ€™ve seen you fight, struggle, and 
      rise above challenges most people would have given up on...
    </p>
    <p>
      Baby, this 2-year journey is not just about your business. Itâ€™s a story of who you are â€” 
      a strong, powerful, and unstoppable woman. Iâ€™m blessed to witness your growth, and I promise 
      Iâ€™ll always be here, cheering you on, reminding you how amazing you are, and loving you every step of the way.
    </p>
    <p>With all my heart,<br>[Your Name]</p>

      <h3>Two Years Strong</h3>
      <p>
        Two years ago, you planted a seed,<br>
        With hope in your heart, and faith you would lead.<br>
        Through trials and tears, you chose not to fall,<br>
        You built a dream, and you gave it your all.<br><br>
        Your journey inspires, your courage shines bright,<br>
        You turn the darkest struggles into light.<br>
        My love, my pride, forever youâ€™ll be,<br>
        A Queen, a fighter, an angel to me.
